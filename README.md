# cucumber-slices-maven-plugin
The Cucumber Slices Plugin is designed to parse Cucumber feature files with 1 or more scenarios into many feature files, each with 1 scenario per feature file. The plugin can be used in combination with either the [Maven Surefire Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/) or the [Maven Failsafe Plugin](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/) to run each of the generated feature files in parallel. Further information on how to configure these plugins to run Cucumber feature files in parallel is discussed below.
